        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p id="Bio">
          JayTee has been producing on the Montreal scene for three years. She
          started DJing for friends’ parties, but she quickly earned a
          reputation for her energetic and melodic style, and the demand for her
          music meant that she was soon playing shows around town for a growing
          audience. She’s appeared with artists like Crazed Monarch, Light
          Without Heat, Distant Son, and Tranquility Race. Her tracks have been
          featured on radio in Montreal and Toronto, and she’ll be appearing at
          the Montreal Beat Festival along with Dr. Rephlekshun, who features
          her sounds on his new track, Hate Rebate. Look for her upcoming shows
          in the Montreal area—come on down, and experience the sound.
